Implementation of DESIGN PATTERNS in Java


# Design Patterns
Design patterns, as name suggest, are solutions for most commonly (and frequently) occurred problems while designing a software. These patterns are mostly “evolved” rather than “discovered”. A lot of learning, by lots of professional, have been summarized into these design patterns. None of these patterns force you anything in regard to implementation; they are just guidelines to solve a particular problem – in a particular way – in particular contexts. Code implementation is your responsibility.

# Types of pattrns
1. Creational Design Patterns
2. Structural Design Patterns
3. Behavioral Design Patterns

# Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors. They make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.

# Structural Design Patterns
These design patterns show you how to glue different pieces of a system together in a flexible and extensible fashion. Structural patterns help you guarantee that when one of the parts changes, the entire structure does not need to change.

# Behavioral Design Patterns
A behavioral pattern abstracts an action you want to take from the object or class that takes the action. By changing the object or class, you can change the algorithm used, the objects affected, or the behavior, while still retaining the same basic interface for client classes.
